      <p class="blogpara">Under Section 349(a)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), a U.S.
        citizen may renounce his or her citizenship by signing an oath of renunciation or by voluntarily; where they can
        make a formal renunciation of nationality before a U.S. diplomatic or consular officer outside the United
        States.</p>
      <p class="blogpara">As complex as it may sound, renunciation of citizenship isn’t something that you want to
        decide abruptly.
        In fact, it is one of the most solemn decisions anyone can make. With that, you must consider certain factors,
        such as lengthy process, extensive paperwork, fees, interviews, and tax implications before you decide.</p>

        Citizenship?</h2>

            meet either a consul or embassy representative</a>
        </span>. Such a representative will give you insights into the repercussions of renouncing U.S. citizenship.
        From there, you will need to gather all the requirements needed including the documents that will be submitted
        to the Internal revenue Services (IRS).
      </p>
      <p class="blogpara">In complying with the IRS requirements, you must file and fill out <span
          class="text-red-600"><a class="underline" href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8854"> Form 8854</a>
        </span>. On top of that, you must make sure that your income tax filing is updated (it is applied to permanent
        residents and those who acquired citizenship). Moreover, there are five basic steps to renounce U.S.
        citizenship. Here are the following:</p>
      <ul class="blogul">
        <li class="blogli"><span class="blogtext"><span class="blogspan"> Speak to a U.S. immigration lawyer.</span>
            While you have the right to renounce your U.S. citizenship, this process can be complicated and
            time-consuming. Thus, it is essential to understand what renunciation means and how it will affect you and
            your family. Though you may be motivated by philosophical differences and tax benefits, you should ensure
            that renunciation is the best thing for you. Thus, you should think about it and weigh the downsides vs. its
            benefits, since renunciation is irrevocable. With that in mind, speaking to an experienced U.S. immigration
            lawyer is crucial before proceeding.</span></li>
        <li class="blogli"><span class="blogtext"><span class="blogspan"> Determine your new home.</span> When you want
            to renounce your U.S. citizenship, you must file it at a consular office outside the United States. Even
            though choosing a consular office located in your new home country isn’t compulsory, most individuals opt to
            do so out of convenience. Moreover, it is highly recommended that you acquire legal status in your new home
            country when you have decided to renounce your U.S. citizenship. By doing so, you won’t become stateless
            during renunciation. </span></li>
        <li class="blogli"><span class="blogtext"><span class="blogspan">Prepare U.S. Renunciation Forms.</span> Before
            your renunciation appointment, you have to prepare and fill out Form DS- 4079 (Request for Determination of
            Possible Loss of United States Citizenship). In addition to that, State Department will also use several
            forms to process your renunciation such as DS-4080 ( oath of renunciation of the Nationality of the United
            States), DS-4081 (Statement of Understanding Concerning the Consequences and Ramifications of relinquishment
            or Renunciation of U.S citizenship), DS-4082 (Witnesses’ Attestation Renunciation/Relinquishment of

              Appointment.</span> As mentioned earlier, it is not necessary to choose a consular office in your new home
            country when filing for renunciation. However, it is probably more convenient to schedule an appointment
            within your new state so you don’t have to travel outside your country of residency. Moreover, you have to
            bring with you your U.S. passport, new passport, birth certificate, and other identification along with the
            DS-4079, when attending the renunciation appointment. At the end of your appointment, you will be given
            DS-4083 as physical proof that you have completed the renunciation process.</span> </li>
        <li class="blogli"><span class="blogtext"><span class="blogspan">Prepare a Final U.S. tax Return.</span> After
            processing the renunciation of .your U.S. citizenship, you will need to settle your tax obligation with the
            United States. As such, your last tax return will be from January 1 through the day you expatriate. On top
            of the final tax return, filing for IRS Form 8854 (Expatriation Information Statement) is also needed.

      <h2 class="bloghead">How Long Does it Take to Renounce U.S. Citizenship?
      </h2>
      <p class="blogpara">When you have decided to renounce your U.S. citizenship, you should expect a lengthy process
        and significant waiting time. Since your loss of Nationality application and other necessary documents will be
        forwarded to the Department of State for consideration and adjudication, it will take some time — between 3-6
        months — before you’ll get the result of renouncing your citizenship.
      </p>
      <p class="blogpara">As such, all your U.S. citizenship files will be retained until your Loss of nationality
        application is adjudicated by the Department of State. During such time, the consulate will reach out to you
        with their determination. </p>

      <h2 class="bloghead">What are the Benefits of Renouncing Your
        US
        Citizenship?</h2>
      <p class="blogpara">Renouncing U.S. citizenship is
        a lengthy process. However, with the
        increasing frustration over FATCA and U.S. taxes, it is understandable why a lot of U.S. ex-pats decide to
        renounce their citizenship despite the long procedure. As such, when your US citizenship has been
        renounced, your tax burden will be significantly reduced and you’ll no longer be paying tax on your
        worldwide income.</p>
      <p class="blogpara">However, you’ll still need to
        have tax payments on your business inside
        the United States. But from the date of your expatriation, you’ll become an alien and no longer be
        required to file taxes as a US citizen. It means that renouncing citizenship will reduce the monetary
        burden of taxation where you’ll no longer be required to fill out Form 5471 for foreign companies, file a
        US tax return, or report your bank accounts with the FBAR form. However, even if you renounce, you will
        still be responsible for U.S. tax if you meet the <span class="text-red-600"><a class="underline"

      <h2 class="bloghead">What’s the Fee for Renouncing your US
        Citizenship?
      </h2>
      <p class="blogpara">The renunciation of your U.S.
        citizenship alone will cost you $2,350. On
        top of that, during the process, you have to travel at least once to the U.S. consulate to take the
        interview and the renunciation oath. When it comes to tax matters, you have to pay back your past taxes if
        ever you are not been tax compliant for the past 5 years. </p>
      <p class="blogpara">Plus, you will also have to
        include exit tax on the overall cost if you
        have met the criteria for such tax implication. Furthermore, you will also have to pay for acquiring
        second citizenship in your new home country if you don’t want to be at risk of becoming stateless. </p>

      <h2 class="bloghead">Tax Implications</h2>
      <p class="blogpara">Renunciation has
        numerous implications, including financial, political, and legal, just to name a few. Not to be ignored
        are the tax implications you have to face when you renounce your U.S. citizenship, which often disappears
        off the radar during the entire process. </p>
      <p class="blogpara">Yes, that’s right! Even
        though renunciation of U.S citizenship may sound alluring, it doesn’t come without its own set of tax
        rules and considerations based on tax law. With this, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act
        (HEART Act) of 2008 dramatically revised the tax consequences related to the renunciation of U.S
        citizenship in two essential ways. These are:</p>
      <ul class="blogul">
        <li class="blogli"><span class="blogtext"><span class="blogspan"> The
              introduction of the exit tax. </span>This change applies upon the termination of long-term permanent
            residency, which is called “covered expatriate or the renunciation of citizenship.</span></li>
        <li class="blogli"><span class="blogtext"><span class="blogspan">
              The introduction of the Section 2801 tax.</span>This change applies to gifts from a covered
            expatriate.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="blogpara">Here are the following tax
        implications you may encounter once you renounce your U.S. citizenship.</p>

      <h2 class="bloghead">Exit Tax</h2>
      <p class="blogpara">The exit tax applies to both
        green card holders (who relinquish their green cards) and covered expatriates (who relinquish their
        citizenship). This tax is on the built-in appreciation in the properties of an expatriate as if it had been
        sold for its fair market value on the day prior to expatriation. Where it has a current maximum capital
        gains rate of 23.8%, which includes the 3.8% net investment income tax and 20% capital gains tax.
      </p>
      <p class="blogpara">
        Furthermore, exit tax will be triggered if any of the following are true:
      </p>
      <ul class="blogul">
        <li class="blogli"><span class="blogtext">Your annual net income tax for 5 years until
            the
            date of expatriation is beyond the specified amount which is $171,000 (for 2020) and will be adjusted
            for inflation; </span></li>
        <li class="blogli"><span class="blogtext">You have failed to certify on Form 8854 which
            is
            proof that you have complied with all the U.S. federal tax obligations for 5 years before the date of
            the termination of your residency or expatriation. </span>
        </li>
        <li class="blogli"><span class="blogtext">Your net worth is $2,000,000 or more at the
            time of
            your termination or expatriation.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="blogpara">If you have failed any of the
        above criteria, you will be designated as a <span class="text-red-600"><a class="underline"
            href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/expatriation-tax"> covered expatriate</a>
        </span> by the
        Internal Revenue Code (IRC). In this case, you will be subject to the exit tax on the net unrealized profit
        in your property as if it had been sold for its fair market value on the day preceding the expatriation
        date. </p>

      <h2 class="bloghead">Past taxes </h2>
      <p class="blogpara">A taxpayer who has delinquent
        tax debt should consider applying for an IRS tax amnesty program. It is a wise step to clear past taxes and
        keep the IRS penalties at bay before renouncing U.S. citizenship. The U.S. expats may avail of the <span
          class="text-red-600"><a class="underline"
            href="https://mindthetax.com/streamlined-foreign-offshore-procedures/"> Streamlined Filing Compliance
            Procedure</a></span> if they fail to file taxes on time
        due to non-willful conduct.
      </p>
      <p class="blogpara">
        According to this tax amnesty program, the taxpayer is required to file three (3) years of tax returns, and
        six (6) years of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR). A delinquent U.S expatriate who complies with
        this process should pay for their past taxes with corresponding interest. However, these individuals are not
        subject to face any penalties.
      </p>
      <p class="blogpara">
        The IRS can (and will) <span class="text-red-600"><a class="underline"
            href="https://mindthetax.com/irs-revoking-passports/"> revoke or deny your passport for unpaid
            tax</a></span>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="bloghead">Estate Tax</h2>
      <p class="blogpara">Generally, the estate tax
        implication can be applied to all property under the name of a U.S. citizen and to a U.S. property owned by
        a non-U.S. citizen. While renunciation of U.S. citizenship may protect non-U.S. properties and assets from
        estate tax exposure, it can greatly increase the exposure of U.S. assets owned at death, such as U.S. stocks
        and real estate.
      </p>
      <p class="blogpara">
        Why? It is because a U.S. citizen can protect $11.8 million of properties and assets from the estate tax
        while a non-U.S. citizen can only shield $60,000 of U.S. properties and assets from such tax implications.
        The cost of this often unforeseen tax can be significantly high because of the estate tax rate, which has a
        maximum rate of 40%.
      </p>

      <h2 class="bloghead">Social Security and Retirement Payments
        After
        Renunciation</h2>
      <p class="blogpara">After you have successfully
        renounced your U.S. citizenship, you are still eligible for Social Security — only if you are qualified with
        enough credit. Plus, you can still receive and enjoy 401K and your retirement income. But, these are all
        subject to US tax. However, military pension benefits are revoked when an ex-pat has left the United States
        and is being called out of the active military role as a non-citizen. Here, you might be required to file
        the 1040NR return — except if you have been offered automatic withholdings.
      </p>
      <p class="blogpara">
        Furthermore, the expelled individual doesn’t have any reason to do so, except to report international income
        tax and pay tax obligations. For any changes, you must let the IRS officials know through IRS form 8854,
        then file the copies with the Department of the treasury. If you fail to file Form 8854, this only means
        that you are considered subject to an exit tax, which results in being audited. This rule is not only
        applicable to covered expatriates, but also to those who are green card holders who will need to file such a
        form within 30 days of you leaving the U.S.
      </p>

      <h2 class="bloghead">Can I Renounce My U.S. Citizenship to
        Avoid Taxes?
      </h2>
      <p class="blogpara">Renouncing U.S. citizenship
        doesn’t free you from tax obligations. Yes, that’s right! it is one of the facts about this process. Even
        after the renunciation, the IRS could still assess and audit penalties and taxes. As such, you are subject
        to Exit Tax if you meet the following criteria: </p>
      <ul class="blogul">
        <li class="blogli"><span class="blogtext">If your average yearly income tax liability is more
            than $162,000.</span></li>
        <li class="blogli"><span class="blogtext">If your worldwide assets have an aggregate net value
            of more than $2 million. </span>
        </li>
        <li class="blogli"><span class="blogtext">If you fail to comply u.S. tax for the past five
            years. </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="blogpara">Thus, if Exit tax
        implications can be applied to you, then you’ll be treated as if you have sold all your properties on the
        day before you filed for renunciation of citizenship and you’ll be taxed on your capital gains. Moreover,
        the gifts you have given to a U.S person after the renunciation is also taxable and should be paid by the
        receiver of the gift.
      </p>
      <p class="blogpara">
        As such, it is crucial to pay your taxes on time and settle your tax debt before you renounce your
        citizenship to avoid penalties. Besides that, using the Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedure may also
        allow you to become tax compliant which is a great factor to leave the U.S. tax system with a clean bank due
        to renunciation.

        Citizenship?
      </h2>
      <p class="blogpara">When you have decided to
        voluntarily renounce your U.S. citizenship you will no longer be an American citizen and won’t be protected
        by the US government. You will become stateless if you fail to become a resident of another country after
        the renunciation process. Moreover, renouncing your U.S. citizenship is also giving up your responsibilities
        as a U.S. citizen and you may need a visa when you wish to visit the United States. </p>

      <h2 class="blogparag">How Can We Avoid Exit Tax in the USA?</h2>
      <p class="blogpara">To avoid exit tax when
        deciding to have a voluntary renunciation, you may consider distributing your assets to your spouse. Or, you
        may also attempt to keep your annual net income smaller than the threshold and avoid staying in the United
        States for a long time, falling under the eight years out of fifteen years residency rule. </p>

      <h2 class="bloghead">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="blogpara">Even though renunciation of
        your U.S. citizenship may sound tempting, you should know that this process may take a long time and lengthy
        process. Before you decide whether renouncing your U.S. citizenship is the best thing for you, you should
        understand the pros and cons of this procedure and how will it affect you, your family, your assets, and
        your tax obligations. On top of that, you also have to pay taxes on time to settle tax obligations to all
        your assets to avoid penalties and negative consequences during the renunciation process. </p>
